Meta Data Science
==================
Thomas Levine


## Data science mindset
<!--
-->
> Exploit cheap computers to study how the world works.

1. Store everything
2. Anything can be counted
3. Boring work should be sent to robots
4. Get more data rather than tuning your model.


## Store everything
<!--
Storage is cheap, so you should store everything that is easy to collect.
Store it in the most raw form that is convenient, and don't worry very
much about how or even whether you're going to analyze it.

## Anything can be counted

### Numbers can be turned into anything

## Boring work should be sent to robots
<!--
-->

* Automatic and unobtrusive data collection---not questionnaires
* You don't need full-fleged research plan before you start collecting data.
* All analyses should be scripted.

## Get more data rather than tuning your model

* When I'm asked a question about the world, I adapt the question so that it can
    be approximately answered with an existing and convenient dataset.
* I look for opportunities to use existing stores of data in unintended ways.
